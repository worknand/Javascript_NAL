//   CallBack Hell Vs Promise Chaining in JavaScript.

// The choice between callback hell, Promise chaining, and async/await depends on the specific requirements of your code and your personal or team's coding style preferences. 
// Each approach has its own advantages and use cases:

// Callback Hell: Callbacks are the traditional way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Callback hell, however, can lead to deeply nested code that becomes hard to read and maintain as the complexity of your asynchronous operations grows.
//  Callbacks are still useful for certain scenarios, especially when working with older codebases that don't support Promises or async/await.

// Promise Chaining: Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callback hell.
//  Promise chaining allows you to sequence asynchronous operations in a more linear and readable manner. 
//  It's a significant improvement over callback hell and is suitable for many asynchronous tasks.
//   Promises also offer the benefit of better error handling with .catch.
